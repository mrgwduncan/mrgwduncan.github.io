	<h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
	<p>
        Neuroplasticity also known as brain plasticity, is amazing I was one of these people that believed that once you'd reached a certain age learning knew things would become harder because your brain had finished growthing, The Idea of contuniuing to learn contunes to shape and mold the brian makes sense and is good news!  The really mind blowing part is that thinking your how threw physical acutivities can have a similar effect on the brain is acutally doing them, this makes reflecting on a days work and thinking through that you've learnt to do a excellent way to strengthen your understanding of something. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I really want to adpot this Growth mindset, The idea that when people believe they can get smarter, they understand that effort makes them stronger. so they put in extra time and effort, and that leads to higher achievements, the more you learn about learning the better you become at it, that challenging yourself makes you smarter. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Combinding both this growth mindset and the knowledge that out brains continue to learn and grow means that if you just stick at something and put the time and effort in you can learn how to master it.
