        <h1>Explain control flow and loops</h1>

        <p>
            Control flow is the order that  a program runs code and execution contexts are created, which is determined by the lexical environment (written order and location of code). For, while and do while loops  affect the control flow because the while looping through no other action may be taken as javascript is synchronous.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            To relate this to the car analogy above 
        </p>
        <code>
            Function accelerate (speedLimit) <br>
            If  (ignition === on ) { <br>
            Let speed = 0 <br>
            While (speed < speedLimit) <br>
            speed ++ <br>
            } <br>
        </code>
        <br>
        <p>
            If the car is turned on, accelerate to the speed limit, however this example is not the best as the car can still do other actions while accelerating, like turn or brake cars are asynchronous. 
        </p>

        <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h2>

        <p>
            The Dom is the Document Object model, which is a programming interface to html which is stored as an object in Javascript. We can modify parts of the html/dom using javascript for example document.getElementById(“blogpostOne”).classList.add(“active”) This could add the class active to the element with the id blogpostone, Document being the DOM then selecting blogpostone and adding active to the list of classes on blogpostone.  
        </p>

        <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects </h2>
        <p>
            An array is an ordered list of values, they can be primitives, objects  and functions  or even another array separated by commas. <br>
            <br>
            Let's keep it simple with a list of cars <br>
            brandsOfCars=[”bmw”, ”tesla”, “toyota”, “ford”, “holden”]<br>

            <br>
            You can refer to items in the list by putting the key value between square brackets, the list starts at 0 so bmw would be <br>
            <br>
            brandOfCars[0] <br>
            <br>
            There are built in methods for arrays for example length which will tell you how many items in the array. <br>
            <br>
            brandOfCars.length would return 5<br>
            Object are a little different however they are a list of key value pairs which are referred to by  the key rather than the index (the position in the list) <br>
            <br>
            Let Car = {<br>
            “Brand”: “Tesla”<br>
            “model”:”Roadster”<br>
            “Wheels”: 4<br>
            “Price”:  200000<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            So we can now get the brand of the car by using car.brand or the model by car.model<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>So what’s the difference, and when do we use these different data storage techniques?</h2>
        <p>
            Objects are used to store things with properties where arrays are used to store list of data in a single variable.
