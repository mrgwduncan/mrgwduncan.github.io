        <h2>Got blocked on a simple problem</h2>
            <p>
                The problem I faced was with using function parameters in dot notation.
            </p>
        <h2>What was the problem?</h2>
            <p>
                I wanted to be able to access an object called gradebook which has child values of students Joseph, Susan, Wiremu, Elizabeth each of them had a testScores value which as an ordered list of their scores. so gradebook.elizabeth.testScores would equal [100, 90, 95, 85]
            </p>
            <p>
                I had a function took 3 parameters addScore(book, student, score), book student and score the book parameter was gradebook, the student value was Susan, the score was 80. I knew I could use the method push to add score param to the array gradebook.Suscan.testScore, I want to be able to do this.
            </p>
            <p>
                book.student.testScore.push(score) but this was throwing an error, testScore undefined.<br>
                console.log(gradebook.Susan.testsScore) would return [100, 90, 95, 85]<br>
                console.log(book.Susan.testsScore) would return [100, 90, 95, 85]<br>
                gradebook.Suscan.testScore.push(score) Worked ! but I didn't want to hardcode gradebook. <br>
                <br>
                This confused me to the point of frustration for a while I couldn't figure out what was going wrong, I started googling and read about someone having some similar problems on stack overflow that suggested using bracket notation might be the answer, after a little research on youtube <br>
                <br>
                I found this would do the job done.<br>
                book[student].testScores.push(score)<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                When you know what terms to google its a powerful tool, but sometimes finding the right question to ask is the hardest part. If my frist set or two of search terms do not return helpful results it's good to take a step back and think am I asking the right question, is there another way to solve this ?  This is also a good point to consult the duck! explain actually what your trying to do, while writing the steps down hopefully explaining it will give you a lead, or turn your notes into pseudocode. Personally I get more out of a good youtube video on a subject than reading people's blog posts or tech articles, a solid 5-10 minute video explaining a method or feature is gold to me. I need to practice being mindful of when to try another technique and not get too focused on one approach.
            </p>

        <h2>Solved a problem in an elegant way.</h2>
            <p>
                Also during the gradebook challenge we had to get the average of test scores stored in array, I knew I could loop through the array and add each value together, I knew there must be a better or more interesting way of doing this and recalled that in other languages you could reduce an array of integers to a single value. after a little trial and error and youtube video about the reduce method I was able to have an elegant way of adding all the values together then dividing them by the number of items in the array with the length method. 
            </p>
            <code>
            function average(arr){<br>
            sum = arr.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val);<br>
            return(sum / arr.length)<br>
            }<br>
            </code>
            <p> 
                I learnt about arrow function syntax away of writing a function inline and the reduce method was more complex than I initially thought as well, I didn't expect to have to pass an accumulator and currentValue to the reduce method.<br>
                It felt rewarding to find a more elegant way to write this and I enjoyed learning about new techniques
            </p>

        <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>

        <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
            <p>
                I need to use this technique more, I tend to write notes about what im trying to do more than plan out the code that way. 
            </p>

        <h3>Trying something</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a big fan of try something, I do a lot of trying, it's a good place to start but its not a good place to stay. Rubber ducky method When I get "stuck" on a problem I find this approach really useful, I like talking to myself :P 
            </p>

        <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
            <p>
                I've had a lot of practice reading error messages in the past as useful as they can be, I find it's easy to fixate on an error message then the problem is not understanding what you've asked the code to do. 
            </p>

        <h3>Console.logging</h3>
            <p>
                always be console logging, I use this a lot to check the stat of a value.
            </p>

        <h3>Googling</h3>
            <p>
                This is my go to way to solve problems, google to find some technical documentation and then a youtube video and I'm normally away ! If im asking the right question :)
            </p>

        <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
            <p>
                I haven't had to do this while on foundations, but once we are at bootcamp I'll be comfortable with asking my peers. 
            </p>
        <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
            <p>
                I figure the coaches have a lot to do, this will be a last result for me, I want to be going to the coaches with a list of things I've tried and a good idea of what im trying to achieve.
