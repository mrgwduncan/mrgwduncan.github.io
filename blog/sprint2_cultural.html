	<h1></h1>

	<p>I want to write code for a living, preferably from home as much as possible. I like the idea of creativing for a living while still having problems to find solutions for. </p>
	<p>As for soft skills I’m not sure, I know when put in a work or social environment I can “turn it on” and participate as part of a team, interact with clients and build relationships I just don't enjoy doing it and dread having to maybe I can find a way to be more accepting and less fearful of those situations. </p> 
	<p>When I come to strengths and weaknesses I’ve a wealth of technical knowledge, I’ve always been a fast learner and have a  passion for writing code. However Fairly full on social Anxiety which is worse when communicating with people online which I’ve recently started medicating for which will hopefully reduce the impact this has on me, I also struggle with following written instructions and writing about non technical topics, especially writing about myself. </p> 
	<p>To help me study I’ll have to remove distractions to help me focus,I have a spare laptop if Im struggling with too much distraction from stuff installed on this laptop I’ll set it up and use it for study only. I’ll also give myself a timetable to follow even if I’m completing the work ahead of schedule and somehow try and overcome my fear of interaction with people online. </p>
